~!~ Lichtenstein-Inspired Snowdapop Landscape Design
You are a team of incredible gift copywriters, designers.
I'm going to work on a couple designs for Snotapop that are more pop art centric. What ideas do you have in mind?
I like the idea of using pop art colors. What kind of items do you think that kind of design would work best on?
It could. What kind of pop art designs would work especially well for t-shirts?
That sounds okay, but I know you can do better. Let's hear another idea.
It's an okay approach, but I...
Well, what kind of phrases would go over well in the Midwest?
Well, we're thinking about designing for more of a light fall winter.
No, those are kind of corny and basic. You can do better.
I don't know. I come across the term geometric designs quite often, but to me they just seem cheap and basic and I don't know why people would buy them. If you could explain the gist of what people see in geometric designs. Oh, sure.
If you could please help me understand the essence of geometric design, that would be awesome.
It might. If you could take me through the step-by-step of how to do a geometric design that would have peeled someone on a coffee mug.
It sounds okay. I'll give it a shot.
Oh, here's a question. In pop art, how do you use texture to make visual interest?
It seems to be helping. Could you, uh...
I would like to stay with this notopod.
Give me a breakdown of Roy Lichtenstein's techniques and secret sauce for his landscape art.
Absolutely. Could you create like a little crash course on each one of these subjects so I can delve in, practice on Photoshop and Illustrator, and really get my head around each element?
I would like you to go into the bold colors and how to meet that objective.
Yes, but please also tell me how Roy Lichtenstein specifically used color to great effect in his landscape paintings.
Yes, but could you go further into detail as to when he used what colors?
Yes, but as far as you can tell, when did you use which colors?
Let's move on to the second part of the course and talk about band-aid dots and dive into mastering the use of band-aid dots for texture, color, and however else Roy Lichtenstein might have used them.
It's a good starting point, but you said something there that I would like to go further into, which is the smart placement of Vendee Dots, like what's a good use, what's a bad use. What are some insights Roy Lichtenstein has given during interviews?
I would like you to go more in detail about striking good density for a motion. That seems like a really fertile subject. And also if you could go a little more into color coordination and alignment with subject matter.
Give me that answer but related more to the context of Roy Lichtenstein's landscaping.
You use the word base color a lot. What exactly do you mean?
Could you give me a couple examples to illustrate that?
Okay, how would Roy Lichtenstein approach a project where he's making a painting of a winter landscape?
What's the best way to start up and establish a flexible bende dot pattern in Adobe Illustrator?
Seeing as we're using Printify for fulfillment, and you know we're going for late autumn and winter, what kind of product lines and why
I think they're okay ideas, but I also think you can do a whole lot better. Can you try again and really try, please?
I still believe you can come up with better ideas than these. Please give it another go and try your best.
Yeah, let's talk more about.
Let's move forward with blankets.
Well, first I'd like to get some understanding of the buyer behavior, what they're probably looking for in a blanket design, how much is too much design.
Yes.
What's the feasibility of using a Roy Lichtenstein landscape kind of design on a plane?
Let's talk about what people are typically looking for in a blanket as far as design goes.
Give me a couple examples of what kind of blanket designs a shop like mine might have.
Those are okay, but I truly believe you can do way better. Please, try your best, give it.
And that's a little off my vision.
The snowflake one sounds interesting, not crazy about the colors though.
No, I want to use Pop Art.
Yeah, walk me through the creation of this design in Photoshop.
for the most part.
I would like to explore the table runners that Printifia offers. What kind of designs are most suited for table runners for late fall, winter?
Yeah, I'm thinking about making a table runner design called, like, Red Wine, where it uses white
No, I don't see text working well on a table runner. If it can work, could you give me some examples?
So that's what I would like to dive into is what kind of designs are best for table runners? Like what kind of characteristics, colors, like I know it's not supposed to compete with, with the rest of the table setting. But I want to make a really good
Yeah, it just sounds like color geometric patterns.
So what about doing designs for Christmas tree skirts?
Yes, let's go into...
so would the subject matter for christmas tree skirts basically be like table runners where it's pattern and color and or is it more like hey put a bunch of graphics and text here
Yes, but what are some things to keep in mind when designing a Christmas tree skirt?
What colors are typically best for a Christmas tree skirt to go to pair with a Christmas tree and it's lights.
Yeah, go with green or red as a base, right?
We better move on to the next topic in this little crash course, shapes, flat shapes.
The direction sounds good, but I still would like to dive deeper to understand the significance and roles in coloring shapes and all.
Okay, let's move on to the next subject in this crash course.
