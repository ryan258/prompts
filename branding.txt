yeah we're not dealing with customization...
now assuming we start off with instagram for the social media marketing and start building an email list, could you sketch out a content calendar for managing it all ?
ok since we're on the etsy platform, around what times of year should we be posting our seasonal products? and then when do i switch activities to the new seasonal theme?
so which kind of items specifically available via printify are best sellers (or at their high point) for each season?
ok so first i post them on etsy and then it sits there for 2 months until its peak season?
could you write an example plan for the spring season?

~!~ Developing Shop Personas.
ask me questions that guide me to developing a couple of personas for my shop please.
As far as age, 35 years old. gender:male, although wives do buy gifts for their husband. Education: some college. occupation: cop, firefighter, emt. income range: standard or middle class.
2. They live in the capitol city in the midwest.

3. A lot of them are gamers. they enjoy metal music. they like the outdoors like fishing hunting and camping.
values and attitudes: they are open to stoicism, mythology and the shared experience of heavy metal music.
lifestyle: routine 9-5 and go out to the bar afterwards. theyr'e the weekend warrior type.

Behavioral: they usually get them as gifts. They buy these items at live music events, target, barnes and noble or whoever offers them. They use them as decor for their gaming room and offices to set a mood when they have gamer nights.

Needs: They just want to express things they're into.
brand interactions: Ads, etsy searches, word of mouth from friends. 

The main marketing message is that the design looks legit, and that the symbolism is on point.

they mainly interact with brands through concerts and gaming events through word of mouth with their friends.

They attend world of warcraft gaming events, and heavy metal music events. They were introduced to it though their heritage and being brought up around people with similar interests. I guess one could say they "at some point they ended up really nerding out on the topic."

based on this persona, what can you tell me about their consumer constellation?
