~!~ Nike: Essential Business & Branding
what are the essential business operation and branding documents at a large company like nike?
mind if we go over our presentation for the snowdapop brand? first off, overall, what do you think? does anything seem off or clarification needed? omissions we should consider?
could you give me 20 ideas for how Snowdapop use unique selling points (USPs) directly to address gaps or weaknesses in these competitorsâ€™ offerings?
could you provide me with examples that illustrate 5. Niche Products and Services?
could you give me 10 ideas for a #10. call to action?
ok so we can only offer items that can be produced by printify, how would you imagine the seasonal line ups?
yeah we're not dealing with customization...
now assuming we start off with instagram for the social media marketing and start building an email list, could you sketch out a content calendar for managing it all ?
ok since we're on the etsy platform, around what times of year should we be posting our seasonal products? and then when do i switch activities to the new seasonal theme?
so which kind of items specifically available via printify are best sellers (or at their high point) for each season?
ok so first i post them on etsy and then it sits there for 2 months until its peak season?
could you write an example plan for the spring season?
oh i'm sorry i meant the winter/holiday season
ok so give me an idea of what i'm making each day in the transition between winter to spring product designs
ok with hygge being our main thing, how do we turn that ship around from winter to spring?
