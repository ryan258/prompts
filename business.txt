ok let's start over.

I would like a concrete plan for managing my small car rental business.
Follow the steps below. I want to use the power of google sheets and i imagine there would be at least 

- Base yourself on the web for 2023 best practices in organizing the sheets, but search the internet no more than 2 times.
- Ask the AI Council for an opinion on what you've found, and ask the council the best way to keep track of the cars and payments on Google Sheets to manage the fleet of 90 vehicles.
- Ask the AI Agents to use your AI Council's report to create a plan for me to follow as I build a step-by-step strategy for keeping track of the business using Google Sheets.
ok that's alright, but there are some twists that we see coming like:
 - terms of payment are custom to each agreement
 - we'd want to have probably 2 sheets in a spreadsheet, 1 for customers, and the other for the vehicles. maybe a 3rd sheet that tracks agreements and simply references the car and renter in each agreement and it will be the agreement that holds the columns terms of the agreement

how would that work? or would it be a good way to go?
Do you mean like a CRM for a more capable system?
