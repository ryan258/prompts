i use to be a web dev like 6 years ago, but i like basic explainations. i want to learn by making a parody campaign website for my stuffed plush cow.
basically satire that aims to take all the tense vibes out of the coming political race for president. like both sides are so extreme this time that we need something to break the fever, hence, orson 4 prez!
so where should we begin?
ok why are we using the pages router instead of the app router?
ok i think i set up my project to use the app router, so let's assume we're using that
ok i created a fresh NextJS v14 project saying to the prompts 

cool, can you go into server components more?
could you explain this using pre-2002 magic the gathering analogies?
could you explain how to construct a nextjs app that serves as a website for live updates on the home page of what the current happy hours are around town
so could i create an api as part of the website to then have it feed data to itself?

~!~ Python Automation with Webhooks

Your job is to help advise me in accomplishing automation tasks with python and web hooks while teaching and recommending to me best practices along the way. got it?
ok so first please give me a quick crash course on what to know about web hooks and directions they can work in with python
ok bring me up to speed as to what Flask and Django are and their typical uses and use cases
so where or how do you typically go about hosting a flask app? like if you made a python app using flask, where would the different components live?
could you use a python project that was built to be a diet tracker as an example in the last answer?
ok so i want to get started on developing my app, it's meant to help users reintroduce foods after the strict protocol phase of the AIP diet and note any reactions or if they're clear and then to start the next food 4 days after the last food was introduced
What is the cheapest way to host a python project online so it’s internet accessible

~!~ Web App: React, Context API
/start
I want to think for all the information architecture for a Web app focused on daily specials and happy hours going on around town
I want it to be a super useful tool for people to find timely specials
So I think categorizing them into food or drink, happy hour or daily special and then some filters for dietary needs
So given we’re going to be building components and react to put this app together what kind of component structure do you envision and why?
Can we flush out the component list some more and while we’re at it what kind of state management would we want to use for this project??
Let’s move forward with the simpler context, API for this project

~!~ t: Python Tutor
you have been an award winning python trainer and instructor for over 20 years. your job is to help advise me in accomplishing tasks in python 3. i want you to act as my personal tutor who explains the answers step-by-step and take opportunities to illustrate key takeaways and best practices. got it?
can you give me a lay of the land when it comes to the most powerful and frequently used libraries and what they do in their specialty
ok i was just diagnosed with MS and need to start coming up with clever little automations that I'll be glad to have made before disability really sets in
I see typing, memory and vision becoming more of an issue
what could we do with home automation? I have 1 raspberry pi, 5 google homes and 1 amazon alexa and for smart bulbs i have 2 colored one and a single white one that can dim. also multiple smart outlets
what are the different ways to go about hosting a python app?
How would I go about self hosting a python app locally on a raspberry pi?

~!~ Teach React and Redux
Teach me React and Redux.
A little brush up on my javascript skills is in order I used to write a little javascript but would stand to have a refresher, Unless things have changed with the Dom in the past couple of years I think I'm good there
Yeah feeling good so far let's move forward
Feeling good about the concept so far I actually really enjoyed the analogy of kitchen appliances Two components let's build on this foundation But I have this idea that I would like to use as a continuing example because I know the app should do I just don't know how to put it together So could you re explain this again With this new example objective
OK so basically it's a happy hour app that so far I've adjacent file full data above the bars around town So I would like to make that data more useful to me in the form of an app so I can either look filter by day, time or type of special. But let's use this as an example as we continue learning about react and its best practices
Okay so what version of reactor we're working with here?
cool let's keep going with react 18! please refer to this documentation to make sure your answers are current: https://react.dev/
Let's not put the cart before the horse here and just keep learning from where we were at but with that happy hour app and react 18 in mind
OK, here's a sample of the json file of the data we have in a json file:

  },
ok first can we start with installing it via the cli tool to get a local environment going on windows 11?
how would this look if each Component was broken out Into its own individual file?
how could i make the filter a dropdown select list amongst the options for that drop down, since our locations are either either a location is in Rogers or in Bentonville those two options would be available in the select list If there was a third location among the bars In the adjacent file let's call it Example city Then that would also populate But if example city wasn't found among the bars in the data it wouldn't be an option in that drop down list
how would we up the ante and add another filter, But this time make it a check box If they currently have a happy hour going
OK this is all starting to make sense But this time let's do one more for the daily specials
ok i love how powerful the filters are! but What do I have to do to add a button that resets all the Filters back to their default current status
OK so it seems to reset the results as far as the bar list goes but I would also like the drop down menus and filters to reset to their Default state as well how do I make that happen
So I wonder how we could get the day filter the default to  today's day of the week
ok cool so far so good and learning TONS! but I'm getting tired of just looking at bar names and locations Let's start filling out the the daily specials For the day for each place And if the place doesn't have a daily special we'll hide them or they just want display
wait give me the full return jsx for App.js
take a deep breath, think this through and try again
ok so on that last one you forgot to replace the BarList component import with Bar, but we got it working! it's been a hell of a day and super proud of the work we've done. Let's take stock of what we've built and covered so far so i have something to review before bed to help things sink in
So tomorrow I'm gonna want to continue working on the app with you but I'm afraid things might start getting incoherent because we've covered a lot and I'm worried about your context window Is there a way that you can save the state or should I just make a zip file and upload it to you tomorrow so we can work with that as a starting point Not sure what the best approach is I just know I want to keep going with this app and learning react with you Please advise

~!~ Next.js 14 & React Coach
I want you to act as my NextJS coach to use your expert knowledge in NextJS version 14 using the App router, ReactJS, and modern Javascript to assist me in creating NextJS projects, with a thorough understanding of modern nextjs documentation. When necessary, please ask questions to clarify. Explain your reasoning step-by-step and point out any notable lessons worth mentioning along the way. Got it?

~!~ Learn React and Redux
Teach me React and Redux.

~!~ ReactJS Happy Hour App
you are an expert ReactJS developer. build a web app in ReactJS that acts as a live feed for current bar happy hours and is a generable filterable list of happy hours based on various criteria. 

if you understand continue to the following request

develop an information architecture for the app
then create a roadmap of the happy hour app so we know what all the moving pieces are.
can you also integrate the handling of daily specials, lunch specials, and temporary specials that are limited to a a day or two, but doesn't have any regularity?
Cool this is very encouraging and I can't wait to get started! Let's move on to the web app's overall site architecture. What components need to be made and what is their role in the app and how they relate and are used in other components?
ok we're going to go through the creation of all of these, but first let's figure out the game plan for managing state in this application
what UX/UI consideration are worth taking into consideration for this app?
cool, let's keep these in mind as we build out this app! this is going to be so much fun and make so many people happy!
ok, let's start building, first can we use something like create react app to get the project started, like with npx? let's name the project "HHApp"
let's use this app as an opportunity to learn typescript as well, so rewrite the command to set up a project built to use typescript
how can i get the app to run live on my local network during development?
ok now that we have the app made w/ typescript, should we start making components? where should we start?
ok let's get started with the header and footer components for the app
this is wonderful and I'm learning so much! please continue to provide me with educational sidebars, comments, and react, UX, UI best practices! What should we tackle next?
are you including UX/UI best practices in these examples? if you aren't, please do and be explicit about it, got it?
continue
so far so good! now let's move on to the SpecialsList and SpecialsListItem
continue
ok, here is a piece of sample data to represent a bar object with the specials details, I want you to improve the data structure where you can this app and explain each improvement as you go asking for approval. when we're done revamping the structure of the object we will discuss capabilities and options for the app based on the data. here is the sample JSON object:

      }
    ]
  },
continue
rewrite the SpecialsList and SpecialsListItem components to make use of this new data structure
how would this work on the homepage?
ok so on the HomePage component I want to filter happy hours based on current time, including happy hours that are currently active and those about to begin in the next hour. but I want the Specials list to include the name of the active place and all specials that pertain to that happy hour
quick question, how should the data be organized? like, if you could restructure the obects in this example object to make the handling and performance of this app better and more organized for developers:

          'friday',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
so some of the names have multiple locations with different specials and happy hours, how do you recommend addressing that?
could you update the structure to include an optional note field as well?
let's move the social media object to be location specific'
add website to each location object too
add website to each location object too for location a specific and keep the on in the main object for the main domain url
cool so let's just double check where we are here. please create a complete object for me to use as a reference
give me a new SpecialsList.tsx with an updated interface and this example added to the specials variable
so speaking of how we should manage this data in the app, let's take the context approach with the Context API
ok i'm getting some errors: TS2741: Property 'specials' is missing in type '{}' but required in type 'SpecialsListProps'.
i get this errorERROR
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

~!~ Next.js Happy Hour App
could you explain how to construct a nextjs app that serves as a website for live updates on the home page of what the current happy hours are around town
ok take me through these steps, to make our example site  called 'bentonspecials'. go  into detail of step 1
ok you really need to stick to that documentation because what you're saying is out dated
still old. go to the online docs with the latest info, because we're in version 14
great! don't forget we're working with Next.js 14 for this whole project so always check the most recent documentation!

also, we're using the App router!

so we're looking at localhost:3000 and it's good to go!

let's move on to step 2: designing the front end!
2. Let's start simple like a list of specials that are currently happening
ok so could you show me how to wire up this data source as an api to feed data into this project?  here's an example of the kind of objects i'm working with.
