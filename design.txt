if hygge was a brand what would the new style guide look like?
could you make a companion style guide for the accets?
for the candle labels, what kinds would work for the hygge brand?
give me an example of 5 labels to demonstrate how the hygge brand would use their content elements
ok do it again, but with these scents: Apple Harvest, Cinnamon Vanilla, Clean Cotton, Sea Salt + Orchid, White Sage + Lavender
ok do 5 for the following scent profile: Scent profile includes true, ripe apple fragrance oil combined with bright fruit notes and just a touch of spice. This fragrance is infused with natural essential oils, including cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, orange, and cedarwood
also take these details into consideration as there's only the 1 front label: Packed with immersive aromas, these scented candles come in 9oz glass jars and are one size (2.8″ × 3.5") (7.1cm × 8.8cm). Made with 100% natural soy wax blend, each candle features a 100% cotton wick and a permanent adhesive label where your custom designs can come alive.
can you illustrate an example of #1?
just the illustration on the label please
create a flat illustration, no candle or mockup background
yeah but there needs to be room for the details and phrase right?
ok, add some placeholder text
i meant yes, absolutely, remember, no background wall!
ok let's try illustrating another label, but this time for #3. Label: "Cinnamon Apple Embrace"
but without a background and flat instead of fitting around the form of anything, just flat, for god's sake please!
thank you!!!! let's see another couple iterations
there you go putting things on mockups again...
forget the damn 3d background i just want the flat illustration!
just the label illustation please!!!
what part of "just the label's illustration" don't you understand?
how should i ask you for a result that won't include a mockup of a candle?
Please create a flat, standalone illustration of Festive motifs with apples and spices, using vibrant red and spice colors. This illustration should be purely graphic, with no mockup of a candle or any other product, and no background elements.
could it use up more of the space?
i just want you to make some clever candle labels that invoke hygge
illustrate a label design for #3
quit showing these designs as a fucking mockup!
good let's stay flat and simple! can we add a red apple ?
ok now what if we added some text to the design
yes, surprise me
are you fucking kidding me!? focus solely on the graphic elements, making it ideal for a candle label, and is presented without any backgrounds, mockups, or 3D effects!!!!!
that's nice, but i bet you can do better!
can you make the image ratio 2.8:3.5
how about 2:3?
