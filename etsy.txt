~!~  ðŸŒ… graphic vs product design
I'm having trouble differentiating the difference between art design and product design. Namely, it's the concept of aesthetics. What is enough effort, aesthetic-wise, in a product design direction compared to a product design direction?
Yes, let's explore how it pertains to my Etsy business. Also, remember that we're doing print-on-demand for mostly home decor items, so how product design works in that direction would be fascinating.
Could you give me some examples?
Please see the video description for a link to the transcript.
OK. Summarize what we have established so far.
Okay, let's delve into discussing the difference between graphic design and product design when it comes to creating designs for home decor items that can be produced via print-a-fold.
Yes, let's cover the whole iceberg of what's going on here.
Take me through an example of the iceberg using a desk mat that's available on Kernify as an example.
It helps. Could you give me another example of running through the iceberg, but this time use a basic 11-ounce white ceramic coffee mug for the example?
Yeah, let's go down the iceberg of what kind of designs work well in inducing Kewka on a ceramic mug.
Take care.
Okay, let's go into detail of how we would design Hooga for these white coffee mugs.
Thanks for watching.
If you were a retail buyer,
I would like to delve more into the mind of a buyer who is looking for products like ours. Give me some good examples and some examples where things don't turn out.
Can we go through the factors using Printify's DeskMats as an example?
In a graphic design, what might these buyers specifically be looking for? Or another way to put it, what kind of design advice would buyers have for graphic designers?
What advice might buyers have for designers when it comes to digital artwork?
Yeah, what advice would these retail buyers have for selling directly to customers on Etsy?
Yeah, let's go into detail on Hookah. What does it mean to different personas?
I would like you to write a summary with key takeaways of what we have discussed so far.
Are there any areas we haven't covered that you think are worth mentioning?
Yeah, do you think it'd be worth it having like seasons for how different personas act?
Yes, I'm all ears.
Yeah, but I'm curious as to the timeline, like how far ahead of time, let's say Christmas, should I start making designs for winter and then Christmas?
Well, is it still possible to have a timeline like this starting in mid-October?
Yeah, we haven't even gotten started really in our social media marketing. So, what all do you recommend that we do to capture the holiday season?
Okay, give me a checklist of to-dos to square away the immediate setup.
It sounds okay. What the...
So that checklist sounds okay. So now I'm curious about once we're in that solid position, how exactly do we start ramping up, and what might that look like?
So is there much value in marketing and maintaining, uh...
What about using Pinterest? What might a Pinterest marketing plan look like for our Etsy shop?
