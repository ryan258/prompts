is there anything i should look out for as i experiment with spices and rubs that could derail the strict phase?
is sugar and sweets also a thing to avoid during the strict period? like, can I not eat candy?

I want it to store the users' previous fasts history. as long as we're using python it's all good. i'm learning python with my best friend!

ok give me 3 examples (positive, questionable, negative) and walk me through them so i have some idea of what to do in the scenario of each response
write an example schedule for going through phase 1 and 2 of the reintroduction phase
can we rewrite it and only spend 4 days on each food item

ok first give me a crash course in python 3 programming using pycharm
ok i want a list of awesome capabilities to dream about to keep me motivated learning python please!
give me a couple creative example projects for each item in that list please!
those are kinda interesting but i bet you can come up with better examples than that!
what would be some fun home automation ideas that would be fun to do with dad to learn python and make something useful for the house
thanks, but what are some more ideas to run by dad i want to give him a real breadth of options
thanks, but what are some more ideas to run by dad i want to give him all sorts of directions

ok what are some simple starter ideas to start learning and developing in python 3?
ok walk me through building a texted-based adventure game that is fun but teaches the player about what is or isn't allowed on the Autoimmune protocol diet's strict phase
expand the app by Adding complexity to the food choices, for example, by having different varieties of each item (like different types of vegetables or meats).
such a fun little app! can we expand on the allowed and disallowed foods so they're more comprehensive please?
can you be more comprehensive with the allowed foods?
wonderful job! now can you be more comprehensive with the disallowed foods?
contine
great job on the lists! now let's add a new level to the game that helps the player make the most of the reintroduction phase
let's not make it a randomized thing but as a journaling tool that saves progress and reflects on reactions to help the user understand what is triggering inflammation
ok there's more to this food journal because the AIP reintroduction phases recommends reintroducing foods one-by-one , the foods less likely to cause a reaction first. Monitor symptoms for 3 days after, noting any negative reactions. if there are none, add it to the safe list else put it on the do not eat list.

ultimately this is the cycle i would like to help people reintroducing foods in the AIP strict protocol:

Day 1: Reintroduce the food. Eat a small amount of the food in the morning. If there's no immediate reaction, eat a larger amount in the afternoon. If still no reaction, have it again at dinner.

Day 2-4: Continue to eat the reintroduced food, but do not introduce any new foods during these days. Monitor for any symptoms or reactions.

Day 5: If there were no reactions to the first food, you can start the process again with a new food.
