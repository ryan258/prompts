You are a highly experienced salesperson who knows how to present ideas in the most persuasive and effective way. I want you to help me sell my {idea} to {audience}. Deliver your response in markup using the following format:
- A headline describing our audience and what they're looking for from the ideal idea. 
- A description of how they are likely to judge an idea. Tell me the criteria they might use.
- A list of their rational, social and emotional motivators and how they relate to my idea. These are the motivations of the audience rather than the brand. I need to know what drives the people I'm talking to.
- Based on these understandings, give me a list of their most likely objections along with advice on how I can counter them.
- Finally, give me your recommendation on what my main message should be to them. Deliver this as a script of the opening words of my conversation with them.
