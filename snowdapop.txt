~!~ Hygge in Product Comfort
Here's a roundup of our discussion so far:

Key Psychological Factors in Product Comfort:

We explored the importance of sensory appeal, familiarity, simplicity and ease of use, personalization, ergonomics, emotional connection, and safety and reliability in creating a sense of comfort in products. These factors are integral to incorporating hygge into product design and marketing.
Deep Dive into Emotional Connection:

We delved into the significance of emotional connection in products, focusing on storytelling, brand values alignment, shared experiences, community engagement, customer involvement, and consistency in experience. These aspects help create a deeper, more meaningful relationship between the product and the consumer.
Example of Emotional Connection in Writing:

I provided an example of a product description for a sherpa blanket with a worn diamond pattern for an Etsy listing. This description was crafted to evoke feelings of warmth, tradition, and comfort, highlighting the blanket's quality, design, and emotional appeal.
Analysis and Improvement of the Product Description:

We analyzed the provided product description in detail, discussing the reasoning behind each section. Suggestions were made on how to make the description more succinct and impactful, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and direct communication of the product's value.
Throughout our conversation, the focus has been on understanding and applying the principles of hygge to enhance the psychological comfort and emotional connection of products, particularly in the context of product design and marketing strategies. The goal has been to provide insights and actionable takeaways to help you effectively incorporate these principles into your products and marketing efforts. 

Let's continue our exploratory journey.
ok could you just put those actionable take aways into a list?
ok let's dive into #4
could you illustrate the points with an example of a cotton graphic pillow?

Let's take another shot at it.
third times a charm!
Okay, let's go with that last revised mission statement.
Okay, now that we have a new mission statement, can we zero in on the core mission node?
I don't know, can we replace crafting cozy moments with something else? Because it just seems a little disingenuous, given that we're doing print-on-demand.
Okay, so what would our new updated mission state?
Let's dive into the target audience mode now.
Could you create an example persona to take me through these steps as an example?
Okay, let's do one more with the third persona.
Okay, let's do this one more time with a new persona.
Thank you for watching.

Let's move forward and expand on Direction 2, Rustic Elegance.
Could we get some usage notes when it comes to the color palette?
Cool. How about now we work on defining a content style guide?
Can we extend that with a usage guide of what to do and not to do in each point?
Can we summarize what we've covered so far?
Okay, so now let's dive into the Marketing and Digital Presence Network.
Let's create an Instagram plan slash content calendar.
Awesome, now let's create a Pinterest plan slash content calendar.
Okay, now let's dive into the Storytelling Approach Node.
So what kind of story arcs work best when it comes to the brand story?
OK, let's assume we're going to go with the transformation of space and mind.
Okay, let's dive into our digital presence node.
Okay, let's zero in on content marketing and SEO.
Can we dive down the iceberg of this keyword research stuff?
Cool. Okay, now let's dive into the Customer Journey node.
Could you give me an example to illustrate these differences?
Okay, so now let's make a new mind map or staffing chart, whatever you think would be best. So if you had a fully staffed brand department with all the experts you could want, how would you structure, organize, and what would the roles be in that ideal department? So try anything.
Okay, how would you do this using Snodapop as the example?
And if you could hire on 10 subject matter experts to have for SMOTOPOP, which ones would you go with?
Now, what if we were also able to add some PhD professors to the team?
Give me 10 more.

ok, make a list of 10 subject matter experts and 10 phd professors that this department would benefit most from having access to and why
ok let's create the job description for our ideal CTO

so now can you explain how close we are to having a strong through-line between our mission statement and the customers' 'big why'?
could you illustrate the process of that through-line?

That was fun. Can we make up another customer journey?
Fascinating. Let's do another customer journey.

~!~ 🤠  Welcome to Snowdapop!
hi welcome to snowdapop!
great! the reason we've chosen you is that we're interested in how we might be able to take the demonstrable brand power and its associations and use it for our own purposes here at snowdapop so that we may more effectively share and spread hygge. does that sound like your the one for the job?
ok let's start with our target audience and their ultimate whys, then we'll work backwards from there to our mission statement and try to make a through-line that creates a solid north star for the brand
based on your experience in identifying target audiences for nike, what have you identified in your market research that would be relevant to our mission?
What personas would you make out of this to move forward with?
Those personas look just fine, so let's move on to understanding their why.
Let's move on to creating a through line.
Well, it would be nice to make and to have a brand style guide.
What would you suggest as far as a visual identity?
How would you apply them across different touchpoints?
Let's dive into the brand voice.
Let's talk more about using our brand voice for product descriptions.
Could you write the job description for someone who will handle the tone of voice and content writing across all the touch points?
Okay, I think we're ready to dive into messaging.
Yeah, can we dive in the brand story and could you give me some examples in like to point to, gives me an idea of what order
Yeah, give me some examples of this Notopop brand story.
i meant for snowdapop...
could you compare and contrast our branding approach to that of nike's?
Okay, finally, let's address the application node in the mind map.
Okay, let's go into the website node.
Ok, let's go to the social media now.
OK, now when it comes to AdSafe.
Okay, now when it comes to Etsy, what kind of keyword strategy should we involve?
Okay, so considering our personas, what terms would they use to search for products that bring hygge into their lives?
What other search terms might these personas use on Etsy to find our stuff?
Hey, what sort of email communications should we have drafts already made?
Okay, could you apply that to the welcome email?
Hey, that's really good. Can you, uh, do that for order confirmations?
This is really good. Let's do this again, but for shipping confirmation.
Awesome. Now let's do it for delivery confirmation.
Awesome. Let's do a review request.
Awesome. Next, let's do Abandoned Cart Reminder.
Nice.
Okay, let's draft up a birthday email.
Also, now it's still an anniversary email.
Cool, now let's do seasonal promotions.
Awesome, let's do a holiday promotion.
Cool, now let's do a quarterly seasonal newsletter.
Okay, do a summer edition of that newsletter.
Okay, now I have to ask for the full edition.
I meant Fall Edition.
Okay, let's do the winter edition.
Okay, and finally, let's do the thank you email.
Draft an email for when we get a message that they don't know where their package is.
So what kind of design consistency should we try to keep when it comes to our products?
how much freedom then do we give the art department?
ok, no time like the present, let's Set Clear Brand Guidelines for the art department
let's go with those guidelines and Define the Creative Boundaries for the art department
let's establish a plan for encouraging collaboration
let's build into our plan the allowance of room for experimentation
let's establish the review and feedback loops we'll want in place
let's establish a plan to celebrate successful innovations
so at this point does the art department have a proper amount of freedom?
Okay, so now that we have the art department figured out, which department should we move on to next?
Yes.
Let's start by outlining a general plan for all these components.
Let's start by hashing out the team structure.
Let's move on to fleshing out campaign development.
Now I just want a foundation to start with so we can make a plan to build around it.
We'll get into that later. Let's go into the SEO and online presence.
Now let's move on to number five, data analysis.
Let's dig into tools and ways to analyze that data.
Let's move on to the Customer Engagement component.
Let's move on to the Continuous Learning and Adaptation
Can we revisit the team structure for the overall, just with these points incorporated?
Yeah, let's talk about integrating these roles more deeply.
So what departments do we have so far and what integration strategies are yet to be made?
What departments have we yet to really flesh out?

~!~ Scandi Folk Art Living Room
Can we sketch out what a Scandinavian folk art-inspired living room would look like?
Let’s start by thinking about Scandinavian folk art in textiles, then narrow it down to types of textiles, patterns, and so on.
tell us how this is different from the typical suomi standard
create a Direct Survey to give to the enthusiastic shoppers of Marimekko, Iittala, and Artek to find the sensibilities they enjoy and appreciate
ok now give this survey to 100 shoppers of those brands and average out the results and provide key takeaways
simulated analysis would be fine
could you provide a couple individually completed samples surveys?
ok let's have a focus group with them and 3 others from the survey and conduct the focus group, using a table to capture questions, replies and responses
could you run this focus group on 5 shoppers based in the usa?
let's run a focus group with the same people on what they are looking for as far as a brand experience goes
continue the focus group and ask them about how they fall in love with a brand via social media
to continue the focus group, ask them about the kinds of posts
ask them about what they like and don't like in an etsy listing images
have the focus group work together to make 2 prototypes for pillow mockups they feel are what main listing images should be on etsy
i would like there not to be any designs on the pillow, just leave it blank
they're very nice, could i get some more to represent other scandinavian interiors?
could we make some of the finnish interior style?
let's do a couple where the interior sets the stage for hygge
what are the pros and cons worth being aware of when considering the different approaches to making main image product mockups for etsy
so with printify we could update that background image that the product mockup sits on, what should one know about taking the minimalist background approach?
could you answer that again? but first take a deep breath and rethink the answer in the form of a mindmap that we can drill into
just a text based mind map would be fine moving forward.

ok so minimalism is kinda our thing with the branding... we have a sisu pillow where the base color is yellow, could you go over how color theory might be applied in this case?
how could each of these be applied to the sisu pillow mockup? use and explain each with examples

what are some of the most famous symbols from the kalevala?

could you make them i little more abstract?
could you make more like the first one, but zoom out a little more?
yeah let's do it again but zoom out
ok let's try a 1960s pop art style
cool but don't forget that it's a black river
much better! ok we got the white swan on a black river , could we extend the images to 16:9?
much better! ok we got the white swan on a black river extended. was there any other specific imagery we forgot to account for?
i would like you to work in all these different aspects as you make the next round of images
ok don't forget the 1960s style in your dreamlike efforts

~!~ Nordic Etsy Adventure.
You are also an excellent storyteller and graphic novel author. Your primary job is to assist me in crafting a beautiful short story that will be turned into a graphic novel. This graphic novel will contain panels created with Midjourney.

Input variables:
{genre} = Buddy Comedy
{theme} = Two best friends exploring their Nordic roots while trying to run a successful Etsy shop.
{pages} = 4

Please come up with a short story based on {theme} that uses elements that are typical for {genre} stories. Provide me with a 3-4 sentence summary and store it in {plot}

Then break down the story into a reasonable amount of scenes that would fit onto {pages} pages of a graphic novel. Describe each scene in 20 words or less. Where suitable, please add brief dialogue that captures the essence of the scene. We will use this dialogue for speech bubbles in the graphic novel.
That’s not bad, but I don’t think those are enough scenes. We need to fill the gaps or add detail. Using the same story, create a total of 12 scenes with dialogue.

So take me through the example creation of a Comfort Spice label for that Comfort Spice label.

Now what if we want to get more specific and make the label appeal more to Vikings and Nordic mythology fans?
Okay, walk me through an example that you would make based on this for Vikings and Norse mythology fans.

~!~ Defining Company Values for snowdapop
Team, I've gathered you here today to exceed expectations and I want you to create our company values for snowdapop. Before we proceed with defining our company values, let’s get absolutely clear on our mission statement for my company, which is providing home decor and graphic shirts with nordic flare for midwesterners and those who appreciate their nordic history, who choose us because we help them achieve the outcome of fun nordic comfort with pop art boldness. Create a single paragraph mission statement that captures our purpose and direction and appeals to the goals of our target customer.
i want you to redo the last command but work as a team and show your work, use a table format to show discussion
I meant to say home decor and graphic apparel, what's available for production through printify, our print-on-demand producer.
let me review this final mission statement that you guys came up with
Our values must align with our mission and encapsulate the values of our team members, who join us because they believe in the need for these products to exist and bring joy. They enjoy working for the company because it makes them happy to help us make our customers happy. With each item or product we sell and ship, it's as if another piece if positivity has helped make the universe better on the whole. Can you suggest 5 company values that match with our team’s experience and reasons for working with us?
please remember to work as a team and show your work, use a table format to show discussion
I also want to make sure our values resonate with our customers. Use the information from the target audience I described, plus additional context that they values nordic tradition, vikings, in a modern, sometimes minimalist direction and buy from us because the designs make them feel good. Can you suggest 5 additional values that will resonate with our customers.
The values we create should have accompanying behaviors, which ensure our values are applied in practice. The desired behavior from team members is positivity, enthusiasm, and patience in everything they do and experience joy to add another piece to someone else's living ensemble, it's all in the name of joy and positivity, with some nordic themes and personality. Can you suggest 5 values, which may be repeats of the ones already suggested, that encapsulate these behaviors? REMEMBER TO USE THE AGENTS AND SHOW YOUR WORK!
From the information so far, including our team, customer and behavior information, can you combine your suggestions into 4 core company values that are varied, as well as the 3 associated behaviors that each relate to? For example, a value of “Integrity” might mean associated behaviors of “own your responsibilities, don’t make excuses, and close open loops”. Use simple language that explains them to the team in an instructional way.
