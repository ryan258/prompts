Okay, so moving forward, now let's talk about branding for this ghost story.
let's summarize what we've discussed so far

~!~ Viral Haunting Garage Sale
Let's write the outline of a story Where the haunting goes viral. like it starts with a haunted house that is sold to a young family but this house is full of old stuff because they used to belong to a hoarder this is so one of the first things the family does when they move in is hold the garage sale to clear out all this stuff. well he wakes up the ghost of the hoarder and realizes holy crap they're selling my stuff My precious collection so he loses his mind and the first thing he wants to do is scare everyone at his garage sale like never before so I'm thinking it'd be a good way forward for him to curse all the items that the garage sale Make them immovable and indestructible like whether people can't move it nothing everything is frozen in place as far as garage sale Items go. those poor garage sale shoppers Who are so unfortunate to be holding these haunted garage sale items fall into a world of hallucination And are taken through an unfathomable amount of time to them through the most intense emotions were to the outside observer If just a mere moment is passed until they set it down silently in a mixture of disbelief Performance wander terror just the whole wash of emotions. So it's fair to say the ghost has won this round the family is terrified he is managed to terrify and scare off all the garage sale guests
Now let's take any sense of this being a comical thing out of the picture, this is about the terrifying idea that a haunting in a house can go viral! 

so let's move onto part 2

~!~ Ghostly Vignettes: Spooky Humor
give me 10 pitches for ghostly vingettes
ok let's replace the comicality of it with lovecraftian cosmic dread
can we make them more about a haunting expanding beyond the haunted house?

~!~ Ghost Story Ideas: 10
Pitch 10 ideas for this ghost story.
pitch 10 ideas for this ghost story idea:

ok what about a house that was owned by a hoarder who is now a ghost at rest while the hoards of stuff remain untouched. then one day a young family buys the house and sells off everything
ok now how about we try it from the ghosts point of view
ok let's assume the ghost absolutely flips out and is now far beyond driven
Repeat.
you had an idea of the haunting spreading via shared images of the items through social media that got corrupted, but i still think has promise
this was meant to be a continuation of haunted garage sale story with Cornelius cursing the garage sale items, making it a spectacle that attracts a crowd, the idea is to extend his haunting from the house to the family because they've mysteriously disappeared, but the social media accounts are still being updated with posts about the items, and now those images that are going viral and suddenly people begin to respond in the social media comments of the image that they think they

~!~ Eleanor's Haunting, Fearful Episodes
Tell me about all the components it would take to make a faceless YouTube channel that's driven by AI.
Okay, so give me a checklist of things I either need to make, or develop, or do myself, or set up with AI. Give me a to-do list so I can just do it, and then you're ready to help me with what's next. But first, let's get that to-do list and make things.
Okay, so my idea for the YouTube channel is to take advantage of the popularity of haunting and haunted house videos, or shows that have episodes where there's kind of a predictable arc, but it's always from the family's point of view. You never get the ghost side of the story of the haunting of these people. So that's the point of this YouTube channel. Ghost stories from the point of view of the ghost.
Okay, walk me through the creation of a script for one of these videos.
I would like you to make an example screen.
I like it. Could you write the next episode?
Cool. Let's move on to the next story.
I like it, let's see where it goes.
Okay, write the next episode.
It's okay. Kind of slow, but I see the direction you're going in. So let's just keep thickening the plot.
Okay, let's do another episode.
I think we need to go the other direction with the fear factor.

~!~ Haunted Hoarder's Garage Sale
Okay I have this idea for a ghost story that starts off like a typical episode of "A Haunting" The family moves into a new home but this house was formally owned by a hoarder so the home first order business is we should have a garage sale Clear out this junk. in a way this is like the inciting incident because the ghost of the hoarder is upstairs in the attic at rest. Saw the ghost wakes up halfway through the first day of the garage sale And realizes what's happening and like any hoarder who is seeing all his stuff being sold loses his mind. Immediately curses all of his stuff at the ground sale And anybody so unfortunate as to touch or currently be holding one of his items they are mentally taken to another dimension that seems to last lifetimes taking them through the most intense emotions and while things seem normal maybe a little off because they pause for a second only a second goes by to the outside world but when the person finally sets down the object there's Beach and they just walk off Beside themselves. Who saw the family they're trying to run this garage sale notice people being stupified for a moment and then walking off I thought saying a word. Sell one of the family members you know goes to re-range a table touches one of the hoarders items and is transported to another dimension mentally for a little while and upon coming back realizes so much but one more thing is why people are just walking off in silence whenever they touch something at the garage sale. So it becomes apparent that the ghost in cursing these items Also made them immovable The weather had no effect on any of these items. so there was really no way to shut down this garage sale And word is starting to get around town about this weird phenomenon and it's starting to draw attention yeah if you're non believers you're believers your religious folks, etc.  

Then the haunted garage sale starts trending on social media and now the whole world is fixated on this mysterious garage sale and its haunted, cursed items.
Okay, so think about expanding this story and then kind of breaking it out into a series of vignettes because to further the idea. The family goes missing, the social media accounts are still being updated, and some of the pictures that are being shared on social media of the objects once they've been seen by a viewer, they start leaving a haunting impression on those viewers and you start to get comments in the comment section implying that they think they might be haunted because ever since they saw the image, strange things have been happening. So this is kind of where the haunting is going viral and I kind of want to take it in a direction of instead of one long single story, it's just one story that ramps up into a social media gimmick that I can have fun making small vignettes of whatever trinkets just to help people enjoy their day and also to kind of mock those haunting TV shows.
Okay, I'm starting to see where it's quite a wide breadth of directions, so it might be a good idea for us to put together a style guide for the story, the vignettes, that we can also then carry over to social media.
Can we try again and have more of a Unsolved Mysteries, Robert Stack kind of vibe?
Okay, can we try again? We're going in the right direction, but I feel like some kind of element from the show lost where they're able just to keep coming out with seasons. So much content. So much mythology. What might that put us at?
Okay, so let's assume we're doing the vignette thing. 15 episodes a season for 6 seasons. Give me an overarching story arc that encompasses the 6 seasons. Don't worry about drilling into any episodes of any seasons. Just give me the broad strokes of how we could do this season-to-season.
So yeah, spinoffs, that's interesting. Give me 10 elevator pitches for spinoffs.
Those ideas are okay, but they're pretty average. You can do a lot better than this. Take a deep breath. Really give it your best.
The ideas are getting better, but, you know, I still believe we can do better than this. This is your last chance to lull me on this one.
Okay, let's develop the Ghost Hoarder character. It's living version, it's awakened, vengeful version, and the version of him that causes him to despair the family, take over the social media updates, and let vanity get the better of him.
Okay, that sounds good for now. Let's work on fleshing out the overall story.
Okay, let me make clear.
Okay, let me make clear that the family only plays a marginal role. They're not centered to anything. So, they just disappeared because the ghost was like, I'm taking control of this shit.

So let's take a little aside and look into the motivations as to why people hoard in the first place. What would cause somebody to start hoarding to a degree that they have a problem?
So, given everything we've covered, what would be your plan in executing what we've discussed?
Okay, that's one way. Right. You can do better than this. Give it another shot. Really think it through and then
Oh, fuck you.
I would like you to answer the goddamn question.
Okay, let's focus on getting the main story right. What are we going with so far, and what directions could we use to make it better?
How could this story be rearranged or repurposed or rewritten in a way where everyone ends up rooting for the nuisance, which in this case is that hoarding ghost?
Okay, so I'm thinking that we start with putting a few YouTube videos up. So that would be the first couple little episodes to set the scene. So what seems vital for that first effort as far as getting a storyline and a story hook and people interest.
Okay, let's start making a list of god sale items we can start focusing episodes around.
Those are pretty good. What other garage sale items do you got in mind?
Okay, how could we engineer this story to be a viral hit?
Those are some good ideas. What else do you got?
This sounds like so much fun. What other social media ideas do you have?
Not bad, but what other ideas do you have?
Okay, give me a list of 25 hashtags for this project for social media.
Okay, give me 25 ideas for channel names for YouTube.
Okay, give me a content calendar for a week of all the social media stuff I should be doing daily for each episode.
Okay, could you explain your reasoning behind that calendar?
Okay, can you recap our event calendar so far?
Okay, so let's do the final week of week one.
Could you give me a content strategy for launch week?
Okay, so you don't really have anything as far as a marketing budget goes, so what would you suggest a shoestring way to do this launch?
ok so let's stop and take a deep breath, collect our thoughts and pull together everything we've covered so far

here is a general outline of a story, fill it out into a dr. Seuss style book :

😱 A dark entity invades a woman's home after her trip to a haunted plantation.
🏠 The spirit attacks her children and manifests as a man's face in the car with them.
🌙 The haunting intensifies, with footsteps, eerie feelings, and strange conversations with a man in the daughter's room.
📸 The woman collects evidence, including photographs and audio recordings, to document the activity.
😨 The entity becomes more powerful, causing physical harm and possessing the daughter.
🙏 Local pastors and paranormal experts are unable to help, leading the family to seek assistance from a minister with discernment.
✝️ The minister performs a house blessing and identifies the entity as demonic, focusing its oppression on the woman.
🌟 The woman recalls a traumatic incident in Honduras where she may have become a vessel for the demonic entity.
💪 A deliverance is performed, freeing the family from the entity's grip and restoring their peace.

~!~ Casino Heist Haunted.
You are also an excellent storyteller and graphic novel author. Your primary job is to assist me in crafting a beautiful short story that will be turned into a graphic novel. This graphic novel will contain panels created with Midjourney.

Input variables:
{genre} = True Crime
{theme} = A master female thief, Carmen Sandiego, is planning an Ocean's 11 like heist but the casino is haunted.
{pages} = 4

Please come up with a short story based on {theme} that uses elements that are typical for {genre} stories. Provide me with a 3-4 sentence summary and store it in {plot}

Then break down the story into a reasonable amount of scenes that would fit onto {pages} pages of a graphic novel. Describe each scene in 20 words or less. Where suitable, please add brief dialogue that captures the essence of the scene. We will use this dialogue for speech bubbles in the graphic novel.
That’s not bad, but I don’t think those are enough scenes. We need to fill the gaps or add detail. Using the same story, create a total of 12 scenes with dialogue.
