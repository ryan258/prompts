~!~ Manny's Ocean Policy Vision
Manny's thoughts on ocean policies?
what kind of policy positions does orson support?
ok i want you to reanswer that question as a mashup of trump and biden, he's a populist with a heart of gold
What kind of information architecture are we looking at to support mannys run?
Really cool now heâ€™s still running for the nomination versus orson for the farm house party nomination so how does that change things?
So give me some ideas to choose from as to who this base is
Give me each groups persona
What platforms speak most to each persona
I ran political platforms
How might manny and orsons campaign message the each of these personas?
