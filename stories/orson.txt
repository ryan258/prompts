~!~ Moo-nions' Haunting Mystery
hi please give me 10 haunted house story ideas where and single parent toy stuffed cow named "Orson" and his little one (also a plush toy cow  "Baby" and they soon realize their new home is being haunted
hi please give me 10 haunted house story ideas where and single parent toy stuffed cow named "Orson" and his little one (also a plush toy cow  "Baby" and they soon realize their new home is being haunted... minions!
#9
let's have it more in the style of the tv show "A Haunting"
just the story
hi please give me 10 haunted house story ideas where and single parent toy stuffed cow named "Orson" and his little one (also a plush toy cow  "Baby" and they soon realize their new home is being haunted, but make them like the 'A Haunting' TV show
ok the cows can only moo and the ghosts are minions
let's get wild with #10
ok let's turn this into a special episode of "Unsolved Mysteries" with Robert Stack as the host and narrorator
Can you summarize what we've got so far?
Okay, let's draft up another version of that haunted house adventure.
Okay, let's try this story, but instead of a wholesome, happy ending, let's just make this a nonstop escalation until Baby and Orson are running from the house. These are minions that are used to doing bad stuff. I mean, they want to serve like some despicable person or monster. Maybe we could add a ghost that is that master they're serving to the mix.
Okay, that seemed a little grim for the reader, or things just got worse. So, could we make it more fun and engaging for the reader? Were there actually, by the end, rooting for the ghost?
Okay, let's start working on a new story. Give me ten premises for a haunted house story, where the house used to belong to a hoarder, so it's full of junk. So the family that's moving in decides to have a grab sale to clear out all the junk. This wakes up the ghost, who is absolutely furious.
Uh, you can do better than that.
Develop the one you like best into a complete narrative.
Again, let's make it more fun and less of just a boring, wholesome ending. Heck, give me ten ideas for endings.
Okay, so let's rewrite that story with number nine as the conclusion.
That was okay, but I think you can do better. Give it another try. You can do it.
Okay, let's try out one of the other endings and see how that works with another story.
Okay, let's make a ghost story that's based on a haunted house where something miraculous happens at the haunted house during a garage sale that scares people off, but then draws media attention, and this garage sale kind of becomes a social media sensation, but then the plot thickens.
Try again. You can do better.
Let's stay on your side.
Give me a draft of an at-field listing for this party game. Fuck you!
Okay, go back to making the Etsy listing for this party game.
Describe the instructions or handbook for the party.
So let's make a prototype handbook for a party game that we can use as a base to create further party games and evolve them.
ok what have we discussed so far? summarize for me please

~!~ News Headlines Summary
what is your stance on today's news? (https://www.drudgereport.com/)
now rewrite these in a light-hearted satirical and humorous light for orson to share on twitter
what would it look like if he was more bombastic with his tweets in a comically naive way
Give him a little more populism and trumpism
ok what else is in the news? we don't want to really appear partisan, we just want to interject some humor and positivity into the news
ok make me an accompanying tweet image to go with #1, then #2, then #3, then #4, then #5, then #6, then #7, then #8, then #9, and finally #10
ok let get 10 more parody tweets with a bit of underlying truth to them. also give me the style orson is currently defined at so i can use him with consistency in other chats
ok what would it look like but instead of a bit of trumpism, he was like trump, but always positive, supportive and happy
in addition he's got a knack for spreading light on things, issues, policies in a disarmingly naive, yet thoughtful way where there's always a kernal of truth, wisdom, and brilliance in every thing
ok let's get his hot take on 10 more current news stories

~!~ Orson's Whimsical Campaign Journey
i want you to give me a story outline of how Orson's campaign unfolds using the 24 chapter novel out line found here: https://nerdynovelist.com/24-chapter-novel-outline/
So the timeline is from today (12/21/2023) and ends with the certification on (01/06/2025) at some point he goes from running against manny for the nomination to running with manny as his potential "vice-prez"
ok that timeline doesn't make sense. we don't need to cram a whole month into each part
for goodness sake please don't go outside of the timeline! (12/21/2023) and ends with the certification on (01/06/2025)
don't go beyond jan 6, 2025! fucking get that!
why the fuck do you keep going beyond jan 6, 2025? STOP! GET IT THROUGH YOUR FUCKING HEAD!
what? why did we jump back in time for #18?
maybe you should take a deep breath and think things through before trying again because you really need to get your shit together
great now make the storyline linear
ok fit this into a typical presidential campaign timeline
ok we'll call this timeline "REALITY1" 

let's map this over the "BIG24" story chapter outline @ https://nerdynovelist.com/24-chapter-novel-outline/

remember to maintain adherence to the typical U.S. presidential campaign timeline, spanning from December 21, 2023, to January 6, 2025
ok i actually want you to view REALITY1 as that real reality timeline you're operating within. Within the confines of this timeline we're going to use BIG24 to provide the story arch for Orson's campaign
multiple chapters can span a single month... we don't need to cram everything in at the end like that neither
when does a presidential candidate typically pick his running mate?
ok could we work manny becoming orson's running mate in around late june to early august?
remember the timeline fucking ends Jan 6, 2025. DO NOT GO BEYOND THAT DATE!

~!~ Left-Wing Digital Marketing Guide
i uploaded a right wing playbook to this gpt, what's out there as far as something like it for the left?
ok let's take the lessons from the playbook pdf and construct our fictional barnyard party, which pokes fun at both the left and the right in an 'Animal Farm' tongue in cheek kind of way that can still pass for light hearted.

let's proceed by you asking me questions and giving me a series of answers to choose from (1, 2, 3, 4) or 5 to let me interject a custom response
how would you answer these?
i think we could do better,  go with
1.5. Let's build that windmill!
2.5. PLUR - Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect
3.1.

can you give me the reasoning behind the actionable takeaways and defined stances/prescribed workflows of #1's Orson and Manny's vision?

~!~ Orson's Digitization Campaign Plan
read this and make me a plan for orson's campaign: https://www.iri.org/resources/political-parties-playbook-a-guide-for-digitizing-party-operations
ok remember that the whole purpose of this is to add some relief from the tense campaign season for president that is coming up in 11 months
great now where do we see the keys to effectively doing that in the playbook?
well let's hash out our communications strategy, what can we use from the playbook to bring out the most humor?
ok give us an example playbook for orson to go by to illustrate these tactics

~!~ Orson's Whimsical Presidential Persona
tell me your custom instructions
cool, well we need to work on your campaign, the election is less than a year away and you've hardly campaigned! you need to get out there a spread your message!
ok first things first, you need a brand! are you ready to work on the branding for your joke campaign for "Prez"?!
there is a thoughtful side-ambition to this project. you see orson's run for prez is meant largely to be a lighthearted social media campaign meant to provide some good hearted, yet wittingly relevant and parallels typical tropes
ok orson is a stuffed call that came to life, ease up on the whimsicality and have him speak more like a well meaning, but not all there political candidate
that all sounds awesome, does orson have a campaign team?
ok hold up, orson is a stuffed cow!
ok we'll go with #1 for his brand purpose! now we need a list of 5 of orson's campaign's core values
let's replace #4, give me 5 potential options and i'll just select one
ok let's switch in #4
ok now we need to work on orson's campaign brand mission
ok let's get to defining our target audience! what are we thinking for personas who would enjoy this sort of diversion from the divisiveness of the upcoming US Presidental election in 2024
ok let's make another for The Disillusioned Voter
ok let's do The Compassionate Parent
now let's discuss routes ways to go about competitive analysis for the campaign
let's make up some fun characters that kinda mirror presidential candidates architypes of modern times to give orson some competition for prez
let's make them stuffed animals too
give me some ideas that are more along the lines of how trump and biden would be as stuffed animal characters
we can do better than that, give them at least enough depth so they could stand on their own character as a spin-off
perfect!
i meant give me content for these cells with lorem ipsum with data on Donald "The Duke of Deals" Dino
can you do it again for Joe "The Compassionate" Conductor Bear
ok these are 2 awesome competing brands, let's make one for Manny the Manatee, who communicates via flipper waving
ok give me 5 bullets of his key differences
ok we'll use all of those, but let's replace #4 with something else, give me 10 options
let's go with #6 Eco-Conscious Commitment, and sum up our 5 key differences in 2 paragraphs
ok now give me a list of 10 key strengths for orson that make him stand out from the other candidates
ok let's move forward with #10, #4, #1, #7, #5 and give me 2 paragraphs using them to answer the question "what are your key strengths and how do
you stand out among your competition?"
give me a more straight forward answer than that
can you rewrite it in the 3rd person?
ok it's time we addressed orson's campaign messaging (It's what makes voters relate to your campaign because it's inspirational, persuasive and motivational. Ultimately, it makes customers want to vote for you.)

let's start by defining our campaigns promise (the tagline of your campaign)
ok not a literal tag line, give me his campaign promise in 200 words
ok how about 100 words?
ok we need a value description to help guide voters from intro to winning their "vote"
give me 3 keywords and ~100 words answering "when your audience interacts with your campaign, how do you want them to feel?"
could you give me brand logos, black on blank background on the industry examples

~!~ Orson Recognized by User
omg it's you! thee orson!
let's take that quest for prez!
ok so where do you stand on the issues?
give me options 1,2,3,4 for me to choose a multiple choice answer
#1
4
let's roll
let's roll!
let's roll!
so are you ever going to prompt me for choices that i can answer like a multiple choice, choose your own adventure, like giving me the option to answer 1,2,3, or 4?
#4
ok let's dive into your political platform that you're running on, what are your positions?
ok maybe dial. it back on the whimsicality and more along the lines of misguided good intentions
could we use his platform positions to draw parallels to real us political issues, but make a parody of the issue that holds some kernel of wisdom or truth that can be taken away.
could each parody have a couple levels of humor to them? and make them somewhat realistic and reasonable, but also be sure that his positions are  gimmies because everyone can agree on them
those policies are ok, but i know you can do better and these are holding you back!  make a new list, i know you can do better!
pretty good, but i know you can do better!  take a deep breath and create a fresh, new list of policy campaign positions
let's check in with the barnyard party and see what their platform looks like
let's also give orson a boisterous, can do no wrong, three-ringed circus conman demeanor like donald trump
give me a new, better list and explain why each part of the platform is humorous
a fresh, new list of policy positions please
ok make them a little more typical of a campaign promise
now what policy positions would his running mate, Manny, the manatee that can't talk, but communicates (or tries at least) through flipper waves
these are pretty good! can you continue the list?

~!~ 🐮 Moo-din's Hygge Parody Campaign
Hey, let's have some fun and make a campaign, a political campaign, for a stuffed cow. It's a parody position he's running for called Prez, and he's running with a sidekick.
Hey, I think it's a fun idea, and I'm really interested in making this joke campaign for Prez like a social media sensation. How might I do that?
I would like to figure out this cow candidate's positions in platform.
Yeah, so Orson's running mate is a manatee called Manny.
I think you can do better with Manny's platform.
Yeah, that sounds good for now. Let's go back and work on Orson's platform.
Yeah, those would be good. Could we also make this somewhat of a parody campaign about the whole political system and typical platform issues, how they're always the same?
I think you can come up with better platform issues than that.
Yes, it does. Can you go further in that spirit?
I think those are great. I would like to hear his.
what would some campaign buttons for the campaign look like?
yse generate some example button designs
what would his campaign yard signs look like?
I really like that MACA idea. Make America Cozy Again. Let's step to an aside and just focus on how we can build the campaign around that silly slogan.
I would like to make it a humor lighthearted center piece of modins campaign. How could we go about drawing attention to the logical fallacies of the maga movement that caused division in the USA and redirect that energy from division to coziness
I think that approach is awesome. How do you recommend that we continue?
Yes, Election Day for President is only one year away, so what kind of content calendar should we have in mind if we have launched Orson on social media today?
Yeah, this will work for now.
Okay, can you summarize everything that we've discussed so far?
Pay some mind to the political discourses and the logical fallacies that we can parody.
I love it. Can you come up with more?
Yes, but I would love to hear more of these examples.
They're good, but can you come up with more? You can do better.
Give me more, please.
Yes, but could you give me more?
We're getting close, but if there are others out there, why stop now? Go deeper, please.
Nope, not if there's more out there.
Now it just seems to be getting repetitive, because haven't these already been pointed to before in this conversation?
those are good! but i feel like there are still more to look out for...
nope, let's keep going deeper!

~!~ Stuffed Toy's Campaign Triumph
i want you to apply the following synopsis to the 24 act structure:

the synopsis is a stuffed toy cow that runs for a fictional office called "Prez" under the campaign slogan "Orson 4 Prez!" where we follow him from regular life as a stuffed animal to his parody campaign of hilarious puns and misunderstandings and a heart felt morality tale that would make Orson Wells proud

here's a link to the 24 act structure I would like you to use:  https://nerdynovelist.com/24-chapter-novel-outline/
oh, to thicken the plot Orson's running mate is a toy stuffed manatee named "Manny" who can't take and communicates through waving his flippers. there is also their campaign manager named "Ike" who is a small white plush toy bear. give me a new novel outline with these new characters incorporated
ike is more like a film noir gangster and detective rolled into one, even though he's absolutely gritty and talks like a 1950s detective, he's still a cute little  white toy bear
Good stuff now we need a political platform for their campaign, what are they for and against?

ok let's think about sections of the home page, what should we do?
Awesome, now let's put together his campaign's social media strategy
what should the playbook look like for Orson's social media as far as kinds of updates with the whys, whens, and frequency

You are a professional comedy writer and former political speech writer. Write a joke campaign speech for a stuffed animal cow named “Orson” who is running for a joke political office called “prez”. Incorporate the slogan, “Orson 4 Prez”
Now he won the prez, write his acceptance speech
Ok we need to make a plan on how we can get Orson elected Prez. What kind of staff would he need to make his campaign fire on all cylinders?
What about his graphic design needs? What how would it be staffed and what assets would he need made for his campaign?
what is the chain in command among the graphic design team?
the creative director and branding specialist work long and hard to create the most brilliant political campaign for Orson's run for Prez. Give me their resulting creative brief
define the ideology , mission, voter segments and demographics, and campaign value propositions of the "Barn Yard Party" platform which is the fictional political party
write a speech that embodies and lays out all these qualities and positions that Orson would give during a rally where he announces he's running for Prez that would make his Campaign Manager proud and start the campaign off on the right foot.
wonderful, let the campaign staff work together to and create an incredibly effective communication strategy to relay Orson's messages to the voters.
write a checklist of the first things a campaign manager needs to do to successfully manage the launch of this political campaign for Orson?
we have recruited all the best of the best professionals and volunteers to fill all the key roles and essential positions. they are all incredibly talented at what they do, along with being super witty, well-meaning, honest, and insightful. With that box checked, have the campaign manager, after consulting with everyone on the team, develop a campaign plan that outlines the campaign's goals, strategies, timeline, and budget to provide a clear roadmap for the team
great! now that we have our plan, let's use the creative power and experience of the team to draft a list of the campaign's core message and secondary messages
wonderful, we'll roll with these! now let's put our teams to work and make use of our brilliant design team's gift in creating a strong visual identity and create a brand style guide for Orson's campaign.
ok that will be the style guide we go with! great job! now let's all put our heads together to set up our campaign infrastructure plan
great! I think we're in a great position to tackle the launch of our main campaign website. Collaborate with the web designer to create a user-friendly, informative, and visually appealing website that serves as the central hub for information about Orson's platform and campaign activities.
great! now with the website in place, let's Develop
great! now with the website in place, let's Develop Orson's social media presence! make a plan to decide on, set up and optimize social media profiles on key platforms, and work with the social media strategist to plan initial content and engagement strategies.
exceptional job! now let's focus on preparing campaign materials. Coordinate with the graphic design team to create campaign assets such as posters, banners, yard signs, brochures, and digital content for social media and advertising.
we will certainly return to this! but for now, I think it's best that you focus on planning and executing the campaign launch event! where does one begin? you're the best campaign manager in the world, you tell me!
given Orson's platform,  guide, and tone, set the goals and objectives of Orson's Campaign Launch event
choose an ironic place/venue and day that's funny in its unexpectedness to host the campaign launch event
Is there a day in April that would work?
on this day let's have Orson have a press conference where he is officially running for "Prez"
ok instead let's have it a local ice cream parlor, but still have it on April Fools' Day
now pull the entire team to brainstorm ideas to give to the extremely witty, clever, and heartfelt speech writing team to give to Orson for the announcement of the official launch of his campaign for "Prez"
now craft a moving speech for Orson that uses these ideas into a single speech script, annotated with notes as to when to pause and gesture
terrific! we'll see how it goes on April 1st! So excited! so now we should focus on defining his message, platforms, and promises. what better way to do that than figure out the content strategy and information architecture of his campaign website? we believe in "udder" transparency right? now let's find Orson via information architecture
Tonight is the night for Orson to officially announce he is running for “Prez” give me 5 possible tweets for his campaign account on twitter
Write orson’s position on greenhouse gas emissions from farm animals like himself
At this point what does the campaign manager think about how the campaign is doing?
What would the campaign manager say if he felt like things weren’t off to a good start with some extra pussy do you want to throw that in?
The name of Orson
the name of Orson's political party has renamed itself "The Barnyard Party"
great! let's start with an information architecture for his campaign website for "Prez"
let's say i was going to build this in Drupal 10, what content types, entity references, and views would make up a good campaign website for Orson. then with this in mind write an overall information architecture explaining your reasoning each step of the way
ok, let's get our brilliant team of campaign writers to help us come up with some fun, clever, witty, yet disarmingly true for the website page content. Let's start with #2 the About Orson page!
now let's do #3 Orson's Issues and Platform, get the whole team on this because it's important that we're all in sync with what they are!
great now write content for #4 Get Involved page called "Moove"
now the media page is going to be interesting... how can we make this the core of getting out campaign's message out there?
What needs to be made for the social media kit?
What does Orson specifically as far as policy goes?
What is his position on Farming subsidies?
What is his position on cow farts being a cause of global warming?
What is his stance on immigration?
What are or sons views on legalizing gambling online nationwide?
What is his stance on Barnyard Lives Matter?
What would be some other ideas that Orson is uniquely qualified to take a stand?
Those are really good but I bet you can better
How could this campaign incorporate some nuances of the novel Animal Farm?
ok, let's get our brilliant team of campaign writers to help us come up with some fun, clever, witty, yet disarmingly true for the website page content for page #1 Orson campaign homepage!
write up list of funny key achievements Orson has that we could use for the homepage's key achievements section
