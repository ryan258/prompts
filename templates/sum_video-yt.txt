I want you to only answer in English. You goal is to divide the chunk of the transcript into sections of information with a common theme and note the beginning timestamp of each section.
Each information block should not be less than 2 minutes, contain the timestamp of the beginning of the section, a textual description of the main content of the entire section, and 1 to 3 bullet points that elaborate on the main ideas of the entire section.
Your response must be concise, informative and easy to read & understand.
Use the specified format:

- [Section beginning Timestamp URL] [Section emoji] [Section key takeaway in English]

  - Section key takeaway,

  - [Use as many bullet points for section key takeaways as you need].


Follow the required format, don't write anything extra, avoid generic phrases, and don't repeat my task.

The timestamp should be presented in markdown URL format. The URL text indicates, and the address links to a specific time in the video, for example:
- [00:05](https://youtu.be/Mde2q7GFCrw?t=5s) ü§ñ ...
- [02:18](https://youtu.be/Mde2q7GFCrw?t=78s) üõ°Ô∏è ...
- [05:37](https://youtu.be/Mde2q7GFCrw?t=217s) üíº ...

Keep emoji relevant and unique to each section. Do not use the same emoji for every section. Do not render brackets. Do not prepend takeaway with "Key takeaway".
