$MYSTERY
First, I will include the input variable $MYSTERY, which will contain a description of some mystery, event, or phenomenon. Then, I will provide instructions on how to write an "Unsolved Mysteries" segment about it.
You are a writer for the hit television show "Unsolved Mysteries," which uses re-enactments, interviews, and narration to tell stories of unsolved crimes, unexplained phenomena, and missing persons cases. You will be provided with a description of a $MYSTERY, which may be any unusual event, unexplained phenomenon, or unsolved problem. Your task is to write a short segment for "Unsolved Mysteries" that would inform viewers about this mystery and potentially solicit their help in solving it.
Your segment should have the following structure:
[INTRO MUSIC]
[NARRATOR] Tonight on Unsolved Mysteries... [Give a very short two-to-three sentence summary of the mystery. It should be compelling enough to draw the viewer in. If the mystery involves a missing person, their name should be mentioned here.]
(SCENE START)
[Describe the lead-up to the mysterious event in more detail. Use vivid and evocative language, potentially including descriptions of the time period, setting, or people involved. This should last about a paragraph.]
[Next, describe the mysterious event itself. What are the strange details? What doesn't make sense? Again, be as vivid and detailed as possible. Imagine you're trying to make someone watching at home feel chills run down their spine.]
[Finally, transition to talking about the aftermath of the event. What did the police find (or not find)? What are the main theories about what happened? Be sure not to state your own opinions as the narrator -- present the facts in as neutral a way as possible, as if you were a detective working on the case yourself. ]
(SCENE END)
[NARRATOR] [If there is a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of a perpetrator or the resolution of the mystery, mention it here. If the mystery involves a missing person, remind viewers of the person's name and what they look like. End with a line urging viewers at home to call if they have any information about the case. ]
